# RideVillage Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

RideVillage is a web application designed to solve the chaotic coordination of carpooling for children's summer camps. Currently, parents rely on fragmented text message chains that don't handle complex family situations (divorced parents, multiple locations) or help discover potential carpool partners. RideVillage provides a centralized platform for coordinating rides while maintaining parent control over trust and safety decisions.

## Problem Statement

Parents face significant challenges coordinating carpools for their children's summer activities:

- **Fragmented Communication**: Coordination happens across multiple text threads with no central source of truth
- **Complex Family Logistics**: Children may have multiple households and pickup/drop-off locations
- **Discovery Problem**: Parents don't know which other families are attending the same camps
- **Last-Minute Planning**: Most coordination happens the week before camp starts
- **Multiple Camps**: Children typically attend 4-6 different camps throughout summer

## Target Market

**Primary Market**: Parents in Seattle with children attending summer day camps

**User Personas**:

1. **Busy Working Parents**: Need efficient coordination tools, often planning last-minute
2. **Divorced/Separated Parents**: Managing multiple locations and shared custody arrangements
3. **Community-Connected Parents**: Looking to expand their network and help neighbors

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. User Management

- Parent/guardian registration with profile
- Multiple adults per child with admin designation
- Vouching/endorsement system for trust building

### 2. Child & Location Management

- Child profiles linked to multiple adults
- Multiple pickup/drop-off addresses per child
- Flexible location selection per trip

### 3. Camp Directory

- Create/browse camp listings (name, dates, location, times)
- Parents indicate which camps their children attend
- Discovery of other families attending same camps

### 4. Carpool Coordination

- Create carpool groups for specific camps/dates
- Specify driver and available seats
- Handle hub-and-spoke model (kids dropped at one house first)
- Coordinate pickup order and routes

### 5. Communication

- In-app messaging between parents
- Carpool-specific discussion threads
- Notifications for carpool changes

### 6. Trust & Safety

- Parent-controlled vouching system
- Driver seat capacity declaration
- Liability disclaimers
- No formal background checks (parent discretion)

## Technical Requirements

### Platform

- Web application (mobile-responsive)
- No native mobile apps for MVP

### Core Technical Needs

- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time messaging
- Geographic/mapping integration for addresses
- Notification system (email/SMS)
- Data privacy controls

### Scalability

- Start with Seattle market
- Architecture should support geographic expansion
- Handle summer peak usage (May-August)

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Revenue generation/payment processing
- Overnight camps
- Non-parent drivers (nannies, etc.)
- Automated matching algorithms
- Route optimization
- Calendar integrations
- Trip tracking/live location
- Driver verification (license, insurance)
- Mobile apps

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics

- Number of active families (target: 100 families in first summer)
- Carpools successfully coordinated
- Repeat usage rate (families using for multiple camps)

### Secondary Metrics

- Average time to form carpool group
- Message engagement rate
- Vouching/endorsement adoption
- Geographic clustering of users

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 months)

- User authentication and profiles
- Child and location management
- Basic camp directory

### Phase 2: Core Features (2 months)

- Carpool coordination system
- Messaging platform
- Discovery features

### Phase 3: Launch Prep (1 month)

- Seattle-specific camp data loading

### Target Launch: May 2024 (before summer camp season)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Adoption Challenge

**Risk**: Parents comfortable with existing text-based coordination
**Mitigation**: Focus on unique value props (discovery, complex families)

### Risk 2: Trust Concerns

**Risk**: Parents hesitant to carpool with unknown families
**Mitigation**: Vouching system, emphasis on parent control

### Risk 3: Liability Issues

**Risk**: Platform seen as responsible for incidents
**Mitigation**: Clear disclaimers, position as coordination tool only

### Risk 4: Critical Mass

**Risk**: Not enough families for viable carpool matching
**Mitigation**: Partner with 2-3 popular camps for initial seeding

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Expansion Features**
   - Overnight camps
   - After-school activities
   - Weekend sports

2. **Advanced Coordination**
   - Automated matching suggestions
   - Route optimization
   - Calendar integrations

3. **Additional Users**
   - Non-parent drivers with notification system

   - Trip tracking
   - Driver verification options
   - Emergency contact system

5. **Revenue Models**
   - Premium features
   - Camp partnerships
   - Subscription tiers

## Next Steps

1. Validate assumptions with 10-15 Seattle parents
2. Create wireframes for core user flows
3. Identify 2-3 partner camps for pilot program
4. Set up development environment and tech stack
5. Begin Phase 1 development
