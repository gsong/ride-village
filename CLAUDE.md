## TaskMaster Workflow

- PRD: @docs/prd.md
- Estimate 5-20 tasks based on PRD complexity before parsing
- When editing the PRD (docs/prd.md), always follow the structure and sections from .taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt as a formatting guide

## Project Management

- Project board: `gh project view 5 --owner gsong`
