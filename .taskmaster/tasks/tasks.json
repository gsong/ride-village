        "description": "Initialize the project with React Router v7 in platform mode, configure Cloudflare Workers deployment, and set up the development environment with Tailwind CSS [Updated: 6/24/2025]",
        "details": "Create new React Router v7 project using `npx create-react-router@latest --template cloudflare-workers`. Configure wrangler.toml for Cloudflare Workers deployment. Setup Tailwind CSS for styling. Configure TypeScript and ESLint. Add necessary dependencies for Cloudflare D1 database integration. Set up local development environment with `wrangler dev` for testing against Cloudflare services.\n<info added on 2025-06-25T03:18:27.354Z>\nBased on the research findings, here are the updated best practices and specific configuration details for React Router v7 with Cloudflare Workers:\n\n**Updated Project Initialization:**\nUse `npx create-react-router@latest ride-village --template cloudflare-workers` which provides optimal SSR defaults with proper entry points for client/server code.\n\n**Enhanced wrangler.toml Configuration:**\nAdd compatibility_flags = [\"nodejs_compat\"] and compatibility_date = \"2024-06-01\" for optimal performance. Include D1 database binding configuration and use `wrangler dev --local --persist-to ./local-db` for local development to maintain database state between restarts.\n\n**Vite Configuration Optimizations:**\nConfigure vite.config.ts with ssr.target = \"webworker\" and ssr.noExternal = [\"react-router-dom\"] for Cloudflare Workers compatibility. Add rollupOptions to externalize \"__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST\".\n\n**Tailwind CSS Best Practices:**\nConfigure tailwind.config.js with content paths specific to React Router v7: [\"./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\"] and import Tailwind in app/root.tsx instead of a separate CSS file.\n\n**Database Integration Pattern:**\nUse context.cloudflare.env.DB in route loaders for D1 access. Implement proper TypeScript types with @cloudflare/workers-types for the complex family relationship schema.\n\n**Authentication Implementation:**\nUse jose library for JWT handling with SignJWT/jwtVerify pattern. Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies for security. Configure JWT_SECRET in environment variables.\n\n**Development Workflow:**\nUse npm run dev for hot reloading during feature development, wrangler dev --local for database testing, and wrangler dev --remote for production D1 testing.\n\n**Performance Optimizations:**\nEnable route-level code splitting using React.lazy(), implement React Router's defer for non-critical data, and leverage Cloudflare edge caching for static camp directory data.\n\n**TypeScript Configuration:**\nSet target to \"ES2022\" with lib: [\"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\", \"ES6\", \"ES2022\"] and include @cloudflare/workers-types for V8 runtime compatibility.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T03:18:27.354Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-25T04:02:47.610Z>\nGitHub Issue #1 referenced for tracking this project setup task.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T04:02:47.610Z>",

Add message search within conversations.\n<info added on 2025-06-25T03:30:29.863Z>\nBased on comprehensive research into modern messaging architectures for family coordination apps, the following technical approach has been identified for implementation:\n\n**Edge-First Architecture**: Utilize Cloudflare Durable Objects as stateful message coordinators for each conversation thread, combined with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time delivery to active users. Implement HTTP long polling as fallback for broader compatibility.\n\n**Multi-Channel Delivery System**: Primary delivery via SSE for active users, web push notifications for background users, email fallback for critical carpool updates, and in-app polling with exponential backoff as final fallback.\n\n**Message Threading Model**: Implement hierarchical structure with global parent-to-parent conversations, carpool-specific group threads, nested sub-threads for logistics, and one-way announcement channels from organizers.\n\n**Hybrid Storage Strategy**: Store hot messages (48 hours) in KV for fast retrieval, archive older messages to D1 for searchability, and generate AI-powered thread summaries for quick context.\n\n**Security Implementation**: Enforce vouching requirements for messaging eligibility, implement automated content moderation using Cloudflare AI Workers, encrypt child information in transit/at rest, maintain audit trails for safety investigations, and auto-redact sensitive details when forwarding outside trusted circles.\n\n**Real-Time Patterns**: Use optimistic UI updates with React Router's built-in features, implement message batching to reduce Worker invocations, establish regional message routing for low latency, and handle offline message queuing with delivery confirmation tracking.\n\n**Database Schema Requirements**: Core messages table with threading support via parent_message_id, message_threads table linking to carpool_id, message_reads table for read status tracking, and indexes optimized for chronological queries and full-text search.\n\n**Resilience Design**: Graceful degradation from SSE to polling on connection failures, retry logic with exponential backoff for message delivery, duplicate detection during retries, and proper chronological ordering despite network delays.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T03:30:29.863Z>",

        "description": "Implement parent-controlled vouching system, liability disclaimers, and safety features for building community trust",
        "details": "Create vouching system where parents can endorse other parents they trust. Build profile pages showing vouches received and given. Implement liability disclaimer system that users must acknowledge. Add safety guidelines and best practices information. Create reporting system for inappropriate behavior. Build trust score display based on vouches and community participation. Add privacy controls for profile visibility.\n<info added on 2025-06-25T03:24:11.193Z>\nBased on comprehensive research into trust and safety systems for family carpool platforms, the following enhancements should be implemented:\n\n**Enhanced Vouching System Architecture:**\nImplement a three-tier vouching system: Basic thumbs up/down endorsements for completed carpools, detailed category-specific vouches covering reliability/communication/safety, and reciprocal verification requiring mutual vouching for higher trust weights. Use bidirectional endorsement model where vouches are tied to actual carpool interactions rather than speculation.\n\n**Advanced Trust Score Algorithm:**\nCalculate composite trust scores using weighted factors including vouching quality (weight vouches from trusted members more heavily), interaction history (completed trips, response times, follow-through), community participation (helping families, volunteering to drive), and account longevity. Store components separately in database and calculate server-side to prevent manipulation.\n\n**Granular Privacy Controls:**\nImplement tiered visibility levels - Public (basic name and camp participation), Community (full profile for vouched families and shared camp attendees), Private (detailed info only for direct carpool partners). Allow independent control over phone numbers, addresses, and family details with separate privacy settings for different pickup locations.\n\n**Comprehensive Liability Framework:**\nMulti-stage disclaimer acknowledgment at registration, first carpool join, and each new arrangement. Use progressive disclosure with plain language explanations alongside legal text. Address specific risks including vehicle insurance, child safety seats, driver qualifications, and emergency procedures with separate acknowledgment for each category.\n\n**Child Safety Protocol Integration:**\nPre-trip safety checklists covering car seat requirements and vehicle safety checks. Age-appropriate guidelines for different safety considerations. Clear emergency procedures for late pickups, route changes, and communication failures with escalation protocols.\n\n**Structured Reporting System:**\nCategorized reporting by incident type (safety concerns, inappropriate behavior, reliability issues, platform misuse) with anonymous options for sensitive situations. Implement community response protocols including temporary restrictions, mediation services, and permanent removal procedures.\n\n**Technical Implementation for Cloudflare Stack:**\nDesign D1 database schema with vouches table including category/rating/carpool_id fields, trust_metrics table for algorithmic scoring, and incident_reports table with privacy protections. Implement server-side trust score calculation using React Router server functions. Cache trust scores at edge locations using Cloudflare KV while ensuring real-time updates for critical safety information.\n\n**Integration with Email Notifications:**\nSafety alert escalation via SendGrid for serious reports to administrators while maintaining user privacy. Trust milestone notifications for new vouches and achievements. Periodic community safety transparency reports.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T03:24:11.193Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-25T03:36:09.873Z>\nBased on comprehensive research into trust and safety systems for family carpool platforms, the following additional implementation considerations should be integrated:\n\n**Real-World Deployment Strategy for Seattle Market:**\nPre-launch partnerships with 3-5 popular Seattle summer camps to seed initial user base with natural trust networks. Implement geographic clustering by neighborhood (Capitol Hill, Ballard, Queen Anne) to leverage existing community connections. Create camp-specific onboarding flows that reference shared community touchpoints and local safety considerations.\n\n**Advanced Trust Score Transparency:**\nImplement \"trust score breakdown\" feature showing parents exactly how scores are calculated - percentage from direct vouches, community participation, verification completeness, and historical reliability. Include \"trust journey\" visualization showing how parents can improve their standing through specific actions.\n\n**Seattle-Specific Safety Considerations:**\nAddress local transportation challenges including steep hills, school zone timing, and seasonal weather impacts on pickup safety. Integrate with Seattle Public Schools calendar for consistent camp timing expectations. Consider Microsoft/Amazon employee commute patterns that affect carpool scheduling.\n\n**Behavioral Analytics for Platform Health:**\nTrack trust system health metrics including vouch reciprocity rates, trust score distribution across user base, and correlation between trust scores and successful carpool completion rates. Monitor for trust score inflation or deflation trends that might indicate system gaming.\n\n**Liability Partnership Strategy:**\nExplore partnership with local insurance providers to offer carpool-specific coverage recommendations. Consider collaboration with Seattle Children's Hospital for emergency procedure guidelines. Establish relationships with family law attorneys for platform liability review.\n\n**Child Safety Integration with Local Resources:**\nConnect with Seattle area pediatricians for car seat safety guidelines specific to local demographics. Partner with Washington State Patrol for driver safety education resources. Integrate with local emergency services for rapid response protocols.\n\n**Community Moderation Scaling:**\nImplement \"trust ambassador\" program where highly-trusted community members help onboard new families and mediate minor disputes. Create escalation paths from community moderation to platform administrators to local authorities when necessary.\n\n**Technical Performance Optimization:**\nLeverage Cloudflare's edge locations for fast trust score lookups during carpool formation. Implement caching strategies for trust calculations that balance real-time accuracy with performance. Design database queries to efficiently handle trust score recalculation as endorsement networks grow.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T03:36:09.873Z>",
