			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup React Router v7 project with Cloudflare Workers",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into discrete setup steps: React Router v7 installation, Cloudflare Workers configuration, Tailwind CSS setup, TypeScript configuration, ESLint/Prettier setup, and deployment verification.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technology integrations (React Router v7, Cloudflare Workers, Tailwind, TypeScript) and the foundational nature requiring careful configuration of build tools and deployment pipeline."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Cloudflare D1 database and authentication",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate database setup from authentication implementation: D1 database creation, schema design and migration system, JWT authentication implementation, session management, database seeding, and integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity involving database schema design for 8+ tables, JWT implementation, migration system, and Cloudflare-specific D1 integration with Workers runtime."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement user registration and authentication system",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into user-facing authentication features: registration form with validation, login/logout functionality, JWT token management, protected route system, profile management, and password reset flow.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to security considerations, form validation with Zod, JWT token handling, protected route implementation, and multiple user authentication flows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build child profile and family relationship management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize around relationship management features: child profile CRUD operations, adult-child relationship creation/management, admin permission system implementation, authorization checks, and UI for relationship management.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving many-to-many relationships, permission system design, and complex authorization logic with admin requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement multiple location management per child",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Focus on location management workflows: location CRUD operations, address validation and geocoding integration, location selection UI for carpools, and child-location relationship management.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with CRUD operations, address validation integration, and UI for managing multiple locations, but straightforward data relationships."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create camp directory and attendance system",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate camp management from attendance features: camp directory with CRUD operations, search and filtering functionality, attendance declaration system, Seattle camp data import, and camp detail pages.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity with search/filtering functionality, data import requirements, and multiple interconnected features (directory + attendance)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build carpool group creation and coordination",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down carpool coordination into core features: carpool creation and configuration, driver assignment system, seat availability tracking, member management with location selection, pickup order optimization, and hub-and-spoke coordination logic.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as the core feature with driver assignment, seat management, pickup coordination algorithms, and complex business logic for carpool organization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement family discovery and camp matching",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize around discovery features: family profile display system, camp attendance matching algorithm, search and filtering functionality, location proximity calculations, and carpool interest indicators.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity with matching algorithms, search functionality, and location proximity calculations, but builds on existing data structures."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build in-app messaging and communication system",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate messaging features: direct messaging between parents, carpool-specific group messaging, message history and conversation management, SendGrid email integration, message status tracking, and real-time delivery.",
