      "taskTitle": "Setup React Router v7 Project with Cloudflare Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into specific configuration steps: creating the project, configuring wrangler.toml, setting up Tailwind CSS, configuring TypeScript/ESLint, adding D1 database bindings, and establishing the local development workflow with proper environment setup.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple moving parts requiring precise configuration. React Router v7 + Cloudflare Workers integration involves specific compatibility settings, database bindings, and development workflow setup that must work correctly for all subsequent tasks."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and Cloudflare D1 Setup",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive database foundation by breaking down schema creation into logical groups: user/authentication tables, family relationship tables, location management tables, camp and carpool coordination tables, messaging tables, and trust system tables. Include migration scripts, indexes, constraints, and validation triggers.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to intricate family relationship modeling, complex constraints (admin permissions, carpool capacity), performance considerations, and D1-specific requirements. Foundation for entire application with cascading effects on all features."

      "taskTitle": "Build Authentication System with JWT",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement secure authentication by separating concerns: user registration with email verification, login with password hashing, JWT token generation and validation using Cloudflare APIs, protected route middleware, and session management with proper cleanup.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to security requirements, Cloudflare-specific crypto APIs, and integration with React Router v7 server actions. Critical foundation component that affects all protected features."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create User Profile and Family Management System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Build family management system with clear separation of concerns: user profile management, child profile creation, adult-child relationship management with admin permissions, family dashboard with relationship visualization, permission validation system, and edge case handling for orphaned children.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to many-to-many relationships, admin permission logic, complex UI requirements, and critical business logic for ensuring child safety through proper adult supervision."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Location Management System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create flexible location system by implementing: location creation and editing forms with address validation, hub-and-spoke pickup coordination, location selection interfaces for trip planning, and location management dashboard with bulk operations.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity with address validation, geocoding integration, and hub-and-spoke logic. Requires external API integration and careful UX design for divorced family scenarios."

      "taskTitle": "Build Camp Directory and Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Develop comprehensive camp system through: camp creation and management forms, search and filtering functionality, attendance tracking system, camp detail pages with family discovery, and Seattle-area camp data pre-population with social discovery features.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to search/filter requirements, social discovery features, mobile-first design considerations, and integration with carpool formation. Central to user acquisition and engagement."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Carpool Coordination System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Build core carpool functionality by implementing: carpool group creation and management, driver assignment with seat tracking, pickup order coordination with drag-and-drop interface, member management with capacity validation, carpool dashboard, and status tracking throughout the carpool lifecycle.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity as the core value proposition requiring sophisticated UI for route planning, capacity management, real-time coordination, and integration with all other systems (families, locations, camps)."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement In-App Messaging System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive messaging system using: direct parent-to-parent messaging, carpool-specific group threads, real-time delivery with Server-Sent Events, message threading and history, notification system, message search functionality, and content moderation with safety features.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to real-time requirements, multiple message contexts, Cloudflare Durable Objects integration, security considerations for child safety, and sophisticated notification system."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Build Trust and Safety Features",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement comprehensive trust system by building: multi-tier vouching system with interaction-based verification, trust score calculation with transparent algorithms, granular privacy controls, comprehensive liability disclaimer system, child safety protocols, and structured reporting system with community moderation.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to algorithmic trust calculations, legal compliance requirements, privacy controls, and integration with local Seattle safety resources. Critical for platform adoption and child safety."
