# RideVillage

A web application for coordinating carpools for children's summer camps in Seattle.

## Overview

RideVillage solves the chaotic coordination of carpooling by providing a centralized platform where parents can discover other families attending the same camps and organize rides together. The platform handles complex family situations (multiple households, divorced parents) while maintaining parent control over trust and safety decisions.

## Key Features

- **Family Management**: Support for multiple adults per child with flexible pickup/drop-off locations
- **Camp Discovery**: Find other families attending the same summer camps
- **Carpool Coordination**: Create and manage carpool groups with driver and seat capacity management
- **Trust System**: Parent-controlled vouching and endorsement system
- **Messaging**: In-app communication for carpool coordination

## Target Market

Parents in Seattle with children attending summer day camps, specifically:
- Busy working parents needing efficient coordination
- Divorced/separated parents managing multiple locations
- Community-connected parents looking to expand their network
